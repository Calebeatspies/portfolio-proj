            <p>
                I am an 18 year old currently attending Make School.
                <br>I've lived in Jordan for 8 years and travelled to more than 23
                countries in the span of 16 years.
                <br>I've played the violin for at least 8 years now and I'm interested in
                becoming a software engineer.
            </p>
